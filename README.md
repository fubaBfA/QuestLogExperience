This AddOn adds an **Advanced** Quest Experience Function to the Quest Description  
There is a Slider and an EditBox for the Level you want to know how many Experience Points you get at the selected Level!

This AddOn is Insired by the WowHead Experience at Level Slider  
This AddOn **requies** [LibQuestXP (Classic)](https://github.com/MrFox42/libquestxp) to work!

As always for my AddOns, this AddOn also have seamless ElvUI integration!
